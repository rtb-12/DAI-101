# Tip Prediction Model Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze factors influencing tip amounts and build multiple regression models to predict tip amounts effectively. Various regression techniques are applied, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The analysis also provides insights for improving customer service strategies and revenue management.

## Objectives
1. **Factor Analysis**: Identify significant predictors of tip amounts.
2. **Prediction Accuracy**: Build and evaluate regression models to accurately predict tip amounts.
3. **Insights for Management**: Provide actionable insights for customer service and revenue optimization based on model analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset includes variables such as:
- **Total Bill**: Total amount of the bill.
- **Tip Amount**: Target variable representing the tip given.
- **Other Predictors**: Additional factors like `sex`, `smoker`, `day`, `time`, and `size`.

## Analysis Techniques
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Scatter Plots** and **Pair Plots** to visualize relationships.
- **Correlation Matrix** to analyze correlations between features.
- **Statistical Tests** (e.g., Rainbow Test) to verify linearity.
- **Residuals Plot** to examine model fit.
  
### 2. Model Training & Evaluation
Models used:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge and Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model is trained and evaluated for accuracy, with predictions compared against actual values.

### 3. Results Visualization
The model's performance is visualized by plotting actual vs. predicted tip amounts, enabling comparison across models.
